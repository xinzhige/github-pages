I am a Senior Data Scientist at Akamai Technologies with expertise in machine learning, data analysis, and software development. I'm passionate about solving complex problems and building efficient solutions. Prior to this role, I earned my PhD in Computer Science from the University of California, Davis, during which I also completed a six-month software engineering internship at Volkswagen Group of America's Innovation and Engineering Center.
